# Reactive Switchboard API

Switchboard network provides a API for subscribing to streaming market-data over WebSockets.

The API uses [Google Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) to binary-encode
application messages trasmitted over WebSockets.
Flatbuffers provides an efficient serialisation/deserialisaton mechanism in terms of both processing
and space requirements.

See our [Developer Docs](https://developer.reactivemarkets.com) for full documentation.
